"Status: Missing Debug Log":

    @{issue-author},

    You seem to be missing the debug log, this is required to help us find any plugin conflicts, addon issues, and outdated versions.
    You can comment or edit your post with the link generated from `/pet debug` (It will generate a `pastelog.us` link)

    Note: If the link does not generate then you can upload the `plugins/SimplePets/debug.json` file to an alternate site (like pastebin)

"Status: Unsupported Version":

    Your issue is based on an unsupported version of either Minecraft or SimplePets.
